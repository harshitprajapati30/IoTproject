# IoTproject
Learnt the basics of a new microcontroller ATMEL ATMEGA16 by i3indya Technologies. Few basic programs of lighting LED, using
buzzers, connecting WiFi module, uploading data on cloud ThingSpeak. Participated in IoT competition conducted by i3indya Technologies.
Cleared first 2 rounds and selected for Final Round at IIT BOMBAY by Radiance.
---- Final Round Project Description ----
1) Idea - To motivate public to use public transport by allowing them to watch the live crowd data between source and destination
   published on a website. This website displays all routes , their corresponding bus numbers and their fares. The crowd data
   was measured by ultrasonic sensors/pir sensors installed at every doors of the bus, thus incrementing and decrementing in
   crowd respectively.
2) Data was measured and was send to the cloud ThingSpeak. When a threshold limit is crossed then it means that bus is crowded,
   else not.
3) Implementing at ground level is much more difficult, hence looking forward to implement it using Image Recognition for 
   higher accuracy of the crowd.
